In this challenge, I have made a password generate that ask the users to select a number of characters between 8 and 128, and then choose any of the folowing numbers, characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters to be in their code. The code will then display in the middle of the page, and the user will have the option to copy the password or not. Thanks for lookign through my code!
